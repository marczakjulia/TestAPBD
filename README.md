In my configuraition file (which let's forget i put here earlier) there is a

-> "ConnectionStrings" defined which is responsible for the defaultConnection.

-> Inside of it, there is a Data Source so the server address and port(seperated by a coma).

-> there is a user id and password, which allow me to access the database.

-> Lastly, the "TrustServerCertificate" which can be either true or false, but in my case is defined as true
